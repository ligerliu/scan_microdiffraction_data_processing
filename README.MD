Here is a package that developed for preprocessing h5 scattering data. The main
purpose is user could quickly have preliminary results during the experiment or befor fully data analysis.

The package is written by python 3. 
numpy, scipy, h5py are essential for data manipulation. Specfic processing,
such as azimuth integrating basing on the ESRF developed processing package:
pyFAI.

matplotlib is prefered package for data displaying and scikit-learn, scikit-
image and lmfit are additional image processing and optimization package.

jupyter or ipython are recommand for data developing but not mandatory.
